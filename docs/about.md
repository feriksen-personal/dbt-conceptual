# About

## Who Built This

![Fridthjof Eriksen](assets/author-photo.jpg)

**dbt-conceptual** is created by **Fridthjof Eriksen**, a pragmatic data architect with three decades in telecom, consulting and financial services — central banking, Swiss private banking, Nordic institutions, global insurance.

Environments where data governance isn't optional and architecture decisions compound over years.

## Why This Tool Exists

This project emerged from a disconnect I've watched widen over the last decade.

Code-first principles gave teams autonomy — version control, CI/CD, automated testing, ship when ready. Traditional modeling couldn't keep pace. Not because it failed, but because the cadence diverged.

The result: teams move fast, but shared vocabulary erodes. Models proliferate. Naming drifts. Nobody knows what "customer" means anymore.

**The opportunity:** bring conceptual structure into the code-first workflow. Same repo. Same CI. Same lifecycle. Architecture that ships with the code, not despite it.

## Philosophy

> *"Just enough architecture to stay sane."*

The goal isn't comprehensive modeling — it's shared vocabulary that stays current. If the conceptual model lives in a separate tool, on a separate cadence, maintained by a separate process, it will drift.

This tool keeps the boxes on the whiteboard alive by connecting them to the code.
