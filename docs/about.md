# About

## Built By

dbt-conceptual is built by **Faust**, a Principal Data Architect with 30+ years in data architecture across Swiss private banking, central banking infrastructure, and global insurance programs.

The tool emerged from lived experience — decades watching the traditional conceptual→logical→physical cascade fail to keep pace with modern delivery, then watching the dbt revolution create a different problem: fast delivery, mounting chaos, no shared vocabulary.

This isn't a weekend project. It's the codification of patterns that survived contact with reality across financial services, insurance, and enterprise data programs.

### Philosophy

- **Embedded over ivory tower** — Architecture that ships with the code
- **Lightweight over comprehensive** — Minimum viable conceptual model
- **Opinionated over generic** — Clear assumptions, clear value
