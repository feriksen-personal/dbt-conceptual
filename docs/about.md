## Why This Tool Exists

This project emerged from a disconnect I've watched widen over the last decade. Code-first principles — version control, CI/CD, automated testing — transformed how we deliver data. But conceptual modeling stayed stuck in the old world: separate tools, separate processes, separate cadence.

The opportunity was obvious: bring conceptual modeling into the code-first workflow. Same repo. Same CI. Same lifecycle.

**The old way:** Conceptual models lived in ERwin or Visio. Beautiful diagrams that drifted the moment they were exported.

**The new way:** dbt democratized transformation, but the shared vocabulary got lost in the acceleration. Models proliferate. Naming drifts. Nobody knows what "customer" means anymore.

**This tool bridges the gap:** Conceptual structure that ships with the code, validated in CI, current by definition.

## Philosophy

> *"Just enough architecture to stay sane."*

The goal isn't comprehensive modeling — it's shared vocabulary that stays current. If the conceptual model lives in a separate tool, on a separate cadence, maintained by a separate process, it will drift.

This tool keeps the boxes on the whiteboard alive by connecting them to the code.
