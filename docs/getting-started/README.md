# Getting Started

Get up and running with dbt-conceptual in minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- An existing dbt project (or use `--demo` mode to explore first)

## What You'll Learn

1. **[Installation](installation.md)** — Install dbt-conceptual via pip
2. **[Quick Start](quick-start.md)** — Initialize and explore your first conceptual model

## Try Without Installing

Want to see what dbt-conceptual can do before committing to a project?

```bash
pip install dbt-conceptual[serve]
dcm serve --demo
```

This launches the interactive UI with a self-contained example project — no dbt project required.
