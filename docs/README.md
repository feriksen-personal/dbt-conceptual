# dbt-conceptual

**Conceptual modeling without the ceremony. Shared vocabulary for data teams who don't have time for meetings.**

> If you've ever taken a photo of the whiteboard after a meeting to capture the model — this is for you.

## What is dbt-conceptual?

dbt-conceptual bridges the gap between conceptual data modeling and dbt implementation. It lets you:

- **Define concepts and relationships** in YAML alongside your dbt project
- **Tag dbt models** with `meta.concept` to link implementation to design
- **Track coverage** — see which concepts are implemented, which are drafts
- **Surface changes in CI** — know when someone introduces a new business concept
- **Visualize** with an interactive web UI

## Philosophy

The boxes on the whiteboard were never the problem. They still work. They still create shared understanding in five minutes.

The problem was everything *after* the boxes — the cascade into logical models, physical models, DDL generation, change management. That couldn't keep pace with modern delivery.

**dbt-conceptual stops at the boxes. But connects them to reality.**

No logical model. No physical derivation. Just shared vocabulary that lives with the code.

## Who This Is For

**Architects who write code. Engineers who think in systems.**

- You advise without blocking
- You're the one everyone asks "what does this table mean?"
- You notice drift before it compounds

## Built For

dbt-conceptual is built for a specific stack:

| Layer | Assumption |
|-------|------------|
| **Transformation** | dbt |
| **Architecture** | Medallion (Bronze → Silver → Gold) |
| **Gold Layer** | Dimensional modeling (dims, facts, bridges) |

If that's your stack, this fits naturally. The tool's opinions align with your patterns.

### What's Flexible

- **Folder paths** are configurable (`models/staging` → silver, `models/marts` → gold)
- **Schema files** work however you organize them (single or split)
- **Existing patterns** (groups, tags, teams) integrate without conflict

### Not a Fit?

If you're using a different transformation layer, a different architecture pattern, or a different modeling approach — this tool won't fight you, but it won't help you either. No judgment, just clarity.

## What This Isn't

- **Not an enterprise data catalog** — feeds Collibra/Purview/Alation, doesn't replace them
- **Not a deployment gate** — surfaces information, doesn't block PRs
- **Not Erwin-in-git** — no logical models, no DDL generation, no attribute-level detail
