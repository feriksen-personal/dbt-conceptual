## The Problem

### What Died

The data architect would sit down with business stakeholders and SMEs, sketch boxes and lines on a whiteboard until everyone nodded. That whiteboard became a conceptual model in Erwin or PowerDesigner. From there, a logical model — normalized, pristine. From the logical, a physical model. Then down to the engineers: "We're building this."

Business would come back: "We need more." Back to the whiteboard. Back to the ivory tower. Update the conceptual, refresh the logical, derive an updated physical. Back to the engineers: "We're changing this, adding that."

Repeat ad infinitum. Or at least, repeat quarterly — because that's how fast this process could move.

It worked when releases shipped quarterly. It worked when teams were co-located. It worked when the data architect owned the timeline. Then it stopped working.

### What Replaced It

Engineer autonomy. dbt democratized transformation. Teams ship daily. The architect who says "wait for the model" gets routed around. No gatekeepers, no handoffs, no time for the ivory tower round-trip.

### What That Created

The whiteboard session on day one is now the last moment of shared understanding. After that:

- Models proliferate without coherence
- Naming conventions drift
- Concepts duplicate across teams
- Tribal knowledge calcifies
- Nobody knows what "customer" means anymore

The conceptual→logical→physical cascade is gone. But nothing replaced the *thinking* it forced. We kept the speed, lost the shared vocabulary.

---

## The Solution

The boxes on the whiteboard were never the problem. They still work. They still create shared understanding in five minutes.

The problem was everything *after* the boxes — the cascade into logical models, physical models, DDL generation, change management. That couldn't keep pace.

**dbt-conceptual stops at the boxes. But connects them to reality.**

- Define concepts and relationships in YAML
- Tag dbt models with `meta.concept`
- See which concepts are implemented, which are missing
- Surface new concepts in CI/CD: *"This PR introduces `Refund` — no definition yet"*

No logical model. No physical derivation. Just shared vocabulary that lives with the code.

> *"Architecture that ships with the code."*

---

## Who This Is For

**For architects who write code and engineers who think in systems.**

- The player-coach who advises without blocking
- The senior engineer everyone asks "what does this table mean?"
- The data lead who notices drift before it compounds

If you've ever drawn boxes on a whiteboard and wished they stayed current — this is for you.

---

## What This Isn't

- **Not an enterprise data catalog** — feeds Collibra/Purview/Alation, doesn't replace them
- **Not a deployment gate** — surfaces information, doesn't block PRs
- **Not Erwin-in-git** — no logical models, no DDL generation, no attribute-level detail
- **Not self-sustaining** — requires someone to care about shared vocabulary

If nobody owns the conceptual model, this tool won't fix that. That's an org problem, not a tooling problem.

---

## ⚠️ Opinionated by Design

This tool assumes:

- **dbt** as your transformation layer
- **Medallion architecture** — Silver → Gold (Bronze inferred from lineage)
- **Dimensional modeling** in Gold — dims, facts, bridges

If that's your stack, this fits naturally. If not, no judgment — just not the target use case.

**What's flexible:**

- Folder paths are configurable (`models/staging` → silver, `models/marts` → gold)
- Single or shared `schema.yml` files
- Your existing dbt organizational patterns (groups, tags, etc.)

---

## Installation

```bash
# No signup. No telemetry. No "please star this repo" popups.
pip install dbt-conceptual
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize conceptual model
dbt-conceptual init
# Creates models/conceptual/conceptual.yml

# Define your business concepts (edit the file)

# View coverage
dbt-conceptual status

# Launch interactive UI
dbt-conceptual serve

# Validate in CI
dbt-conceptual validate

# Export diagrams
dbt-conceptual export --format excalidraw -o diagram.excalidraw
```

---

## How It Works

### 1. Define Concepts

Create `models/conceptual/conceptual.yml`:

```yaml
version: 1

domains:
  party:
    name: "Party"
  transaction:
    name: "Transaction"
  catalog:
    name: "Catalog"

concepts:
  customer:
    name: "Customer"
    domain: party
    owner: customer_team
    definition: "A person or company that purchases products"

  order:
    name: "Order"
    domain: transaction
    owner: orders_team
    definition: "A confirmed purchase by a customer"

  product:
    name: "Product"
    domain: catalog
    owner: catalog_team
    definition: "An item available for purchase"

relationships:
  - name: places
    from: customer
    to: order
    cardinality: "1:N"

  - name: contains
    from: order
    to: product
    cardinality: "N:M"
```

### 2. Tag dbt Models

Add `meta.concept` to dimensions:

```yaml
# models/gold/dim_customer.yml
models:
  - name: dim_customer
    meta:
      concept: customer
```

Add `meta.realizes` to facts and bridges:

```yaml
# models/gold/fact_order_lines.yml
models:
  - name: fact_order_lines
    meta:
      realizes:
        - customer:places:order
        - order:contains:product
```

### 3. Validate & Visualize

```bash
# Check everything links up
dbt-conceptual validate

# See coverage
dbt-conceptual status

# Open visual editor
dbt-conceptual serve
```

## Features

### 📊 Coverage Tracking

See which concepts are implemented at each layer:

<!-- ASSET: assets/coverage-status.png — Terminal-style coverage report showing domains and status -->
![Coverage status](assets/coverage-status.png)

**Status logic:**

| Status | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| `complete` | Has domain AND has implementing models |
| `draft` | Missing domain OR zero implementing models |
| `stub` | Created from sync — needs enrichment |

### 🎨 Interactive Web UI

```bash
pip install dbt-conceptual[serve]
dbt-conceptual serve
```

<!-- ASSET: assets/ui-screenshot.png — Full UI with canvas, selected concept, and property panel -->
![dbt-conceptual UI](assets/ui-screenshot.png)

- **Visual canvas editor** — drag concepts, draw relationships
- **Property panel** — edit definitions, owners, domains
- **Real-time sync** — changes save directly to `conceptual.yml`
- **Coverage and Bus Matrix** views built in

### ✅ CI Validation

Catch drift before it ships:

```bash
$ dbt-conceptual validate

ERROR: dim_customer_legacy references concept 'client' which does not exist
       Did you mean: 'customer'?

ERROR: fact_returns realizes 'customer:returns:order'
       but relationship 'returns' does not exist
```

**CI/CD integration:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Validate conceptual model
  run: dbt-conceptual validate --no-drafts
```

The `--no-drafts` flag fails if any concepts or relationships are incomplete — useful for enforcing coverage standards.

### 🔀 Pull Request Integration

See what changed in your conceptual model:

```bash
# Compare current branch to main
dbt-conceptual diff --base main

# Output:
# Concepts:
#   + refund (added)
#   ~ customer (modified: definition changed)
#
# Relationships:
#   + customer:requests:refund (added)
```

Surface conceptual changes in PR reviews. Know when someone adds a new business concept or modifies an existing definition.

### 🔄 Bi-Directional Sync

**Top-down:** Define concepts in YAML, associate them with models via the UI.

**Bottom-up:** Already have a dbt project with `meta.concept` tags? Generate stubs:

```bash
dbt-conceptual sync --create-stubs

# Output:
# Created 12 concept stubs
# Created 8 relationship stubs
# Run 'dbt-conceptual status' to see what needs enrichment
```

### 📤 Export Formats

```bash
# Excalidraw — editable diagrams
dbt-conceptual export --format excalidraw

# PNG — static diagram image
dbt-conceptual export --format png -o diagram.png

# Mermaid — for docs and GitHub
dbt-conceptual export --format mermaid

# Coverage report — HTML dashboard
dbt-conceptual export --format coverage

# Bus matrix — dimensions vs facts
dbt-conceptual export --format bus-matrix
```

---

## Layer Model

| Layer | Tagged How | Editable |
| ----- | ---------- | -------- |
| **Gold** | `meta.concept` in model.yml within gold_paths | Yes |
| **Silver** | `meta.concept` in model.yml within silver_paths | Yes |
| **Bronze** | Inferred from manifest.json lineage | No (read-only) |

Bronze requires no tagging. It surfaces automatically — showing which sources feed your concepts.

---

## Configuration

Works out of the box. Override in `dbt_project.yml` if needed:

```yaml
vars:
  dbt_conceptual:
    conceptual_path: models/conceptual    # default
    silver_paths:
      - models/silver
      - models/staging
    gold_paths:
      - models/gold
      - models/marts
```
